                    <p><b>Anuradha Koirala</b>, was born on April 14, 1949, in Rumjatar, Okhaldhunga. She was a former English teacher before she started working on Maiti Nepal and dedicated her life to combating the trafficking and use of women and children. She is a hero for our nation and our pride in the world. She received 38 national and international awards. She was honored with the CNN Hero award in 2010. After inaugurating Maiti Nepal, she jumped into the humanity service. Her first work was building up of a home so that she could contribute a shelter for those who have nowhere else to go. Now, Maiti Nepal has three avoidance homes, eleven transit homes, two sanitariums and a formal school. More than 1000 children are getting direct services from Maiti Nepal each day. It was all made possible with her firm assurance and criterion leadership. She was awarded by CNN Hero Award in 2010. It was the outcome of her struggle and empathy to fight the social evil of human trafficking. Her achievement as a CNN hero is a pride and honor to the nation itself.</p>
